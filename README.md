# Humanitec

Frontend test assignment.
<br/><br/>
First of all, thanks for taking your time to review my test, and let me be part of the process.
<br/><br/>

## Using this project

Previous steps

```bash
$ npm install
```

```bash
$ npm run start:dev
```

Build/Run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Testing:

```bash
$ npm test
```

## Frontend:

> Angular 7 and Angular Material
> <br/>

## Dataflow:

> NgRX for data management and routing

## Architecture:

-   App loads a configuration in order to avoid hardcoded data/props
-   Configurable modules, composable containers and factories
-   Solid principles
-   Open close rule
-   Dumb components (some of them with local state)
-   Responsive design
-   Encapsulation of the css

## Continuous Integration:

> CircleCI

## Continuous Deployment:

> Everytime a branch is pushed to master using `Heroku`

## Branch strategy:

> I worked using git flow.

## Facts:

-   This test have a few tricky things to solve so is very fun to do it.
-   I spent a lot of time making the test using the best on my FE skills, however there is always time to keep improving
-   I would have love had time to configure and run the app using Docker
-   It would be nice to build a proxy using GraphQL to give it a bit more of sauce to the test
